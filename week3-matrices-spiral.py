301 Matrix Spiral
Given an (MxN) matrix of integers, return an array in spiral order.

Input: Array of integers
Output: Array of integers
Example
Input: [[1,2,3],			
        [4,5,6],
        [7,8,9]]

Output: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]



Input: [[]]

Output: []
Constraints
Time Complexity: O(MN)
Auxiliary Space Complexity: O(MN)
Values of the array will be digits 0-9.

Notes
Must account long or tall matrices:

Input: [[1,2,3,4]]
